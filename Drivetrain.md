# The drivetrain approach

I will be approaching this project with the drivetrain approach.

1. Define an objective: **classify hot dogs, wiener dogs, or corn dogs with 95% accuracy and only one evening.**
2. Understand the levers: what inputs can you control? Image format: color, dimensions, compression...
3. What data can you collect? **Images from Bing, using Azure search for images**
4. Model the levers in order to understand how they affect the objective. **With such a simple objective, I only need a naive approach. Transfer learning a resnet should be fine**

## TODO
Overall project scope captured below:
1. ~~Get data~~
2. ~~Clean data~~
3. ~~Setup data pipeline~~
4. ~~Train~~
5. ~~Clean~~
6. ~~Retrain~~
7. ~~Test~~
8. ~~Make simply Python GUI~~
9. 'Deploy'? Probably prefer to host locally for security reasons
